# Vocal-Noise-Reducer
A very light-weight machine learning model that suppresses background noise from vocals using Python.

Being a one-dimensional model, this tool is meant more for noise reduction as opposed to full noise removal. The one-dimensional nature of this model only allows it to alter the frequency levels, acting as an advanced equalizing curve that targets areas of high background noise.

An EQ curve like this is similar to the one applied by the noise reduction model. Likely, further equalizing to boost the higher frequencies will need to be applied to create a more natural-sounding recording.
