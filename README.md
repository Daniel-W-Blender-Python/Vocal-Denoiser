# Vocal-Noise-Reducer
A very light-weight machine learning model that suppresses background noise from vocals using Python.

Being a one-dimensional model, this tool is meant more for noise reduction as opposed to full noise removal. The one-dimensional nature of this model only allows it to alter the frequency levels, acting as an advanced equalizing curve that targets areas of high background noise.
